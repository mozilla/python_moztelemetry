python_moztelemetry
===================

A simple library to fetch and analyze data collected by the Mozilla Telemetry service.
Objects collected by Telemetry are called ``pings``.
A ping has a number of properties (aka ``dimensions``) and a payload.

For example usage and additional context on how this library fits into the
broader landscape of Mozilla telemetry analysis tools, see
`moztelemetry on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org <https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/tools/spark.html#the-moztelemetry-library>`_.
To browse the source code, see https://github.com/mozilla/python_moztelemetry

A session of Telemetry data analysis/manipulation typically starts
with a :ref:`Dataset` query that filters the objects by one or more
dimensions, and then extracts the items of interest from their payload.
